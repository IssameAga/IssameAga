## Hi there! 

Iâ€™m @IssameAga or Agatha if you prefer. Iâ€™m **hoping** to be a **former** elementary school teacher, turned technical writer. 
To be a good teacher, one needs to be a life long learner. So Iâ€™m practicing what I preach to by learning to code! ðŸ˜…

Currently I am learning python and HTML.

 Learning is definitely the operative word ðŸ˜¬  
Iâ€™m comfortable with markdown, though in time I hope to be comfortable with other markup languages.

You can reach me @

Iâ€™m open to collaborating on any technical writing that needs to be done for your project!
